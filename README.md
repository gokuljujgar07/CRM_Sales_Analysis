## 🪜 Steps Involved :
1. **Data Import and Integration** :
- Multiple datasets were imported and transformed using Power Query in Power BI.
- Explored each dataset to understand its structure, data types, and relationships between different datasets.
- Established connections between datasets using PowerBI’s relationship feature to create a unified data model.
2. **Data Cleaning** :
- Identified and handled missing values through imputation or exclusion.
- Standardized text data by ensuring consistent formatting (e.g., case consistency, removal of extra spaces).
3. **Data Transformation** :
- This included creating calculated columns and measures using Power Query and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
4. **Data Standardization** :
- Ensured numerical data were in consistent units and formats across all datasets.
- Standardized date formats and ensured consistency in timestamps.
5. **Data Analysis** :
- Conducted descriptive statistics to summarize the data, such as calculating averages, totals, and distributions.
- Used Power Query and DAX functions to perform more advanced calculations and aggregations.
- Applied filters and slicers to dynamically explore the data and uncover patterns and trends.
6. **Visualization and Dashboarding** :
- Created various visualizations including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and maps to represent key metrics and trends.
- Developed interactive dashboards, incorporating features like slicers, and tooltips to enable dynamic data exploration.
- Ensured that visualizations were clear, informative, and visually appealing.

## 📈 Overall Sales Performance

- Total Revenue: $10.58 million
- Total Deals: 8,800
- Deals Won: 4,238
- Conversion Rate: 48.16%
- Lost Rate: 28.10%

## Product Performance
- The best-selling product is GTX Plus Pro, followed by MG Advanced and GTX Plus Basic.
- The lowest-selling product, GTK 500, accounts for only 0.55% of total deals.
- Products such as MG Advanced have high lost rates (18.38%), despite strong sales, which suggests customer objections or mismatched offerings.

## 📆 Monthly Trends
- The number of deals won and lost changes from month to month.
- Notable spikes in lost rates occur in May and August, suggesting possible seasonal impacts, capacity issues, or market resistance during these months.

 ## 📊 Sector Analysis
- The sectors with the highest conversion rates include:
- Marketing (10.42%)
- Software (10.34%)
- Entertainment (10.02%)
Sector performance is fairly evenly distributed, but marketing and software show slightly better engagement.

🧑‍💼 5. Agent Performance
Top 5 sales agents are:

1. Darcel Schlecht
2. Vicki Laflamme
3. Kary Hendrixson
4. Cassey Cress
5. Donn Cantrell
These agents are responsible for the highest volume of sales and revenue. Their methods and outreach strategies could serve as best-practice examples for training.

## 📊 Companies
The top companies by revenue contribution include:

- Kan-code
- Hottechi
- Konex
These accounts represent major revenue streams and should be prioritized for relationship management and growth strategies.

## ✅ Recommendations

✅ Focus on understanding why deals are being lost (~28%). Analyze lost deals by product and month to identify patterns. Implement a follow-up strategy or objection-handling training.

✅ Even though MG Advanced sells well, it has a high lost rate. Investigate customer feedback, pricing, or product fit.

✅ Use the top 5 agents’ strategies to create a simple guide. Help other team members through mentoring or workshops.

✅ Focus on Marketing and Software sectors. Customize your messaging and offers for better results.

✅ Companies like Kan-code and Hottechi bring in the most money. Focus on retaining them and offering upsell opportunities.

✅ Conversion and lost rates change month to month. Plan better during May and August, when more deals are lost.




## Outcome:
The project significantly enhanced my ability to work with complex datasets in Power Query and PowerBI, transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I am now more confident in handling real-world data analysis tasks, leveraging Power Query and PowerBI’s powerful features for effective data visualization and reporting.
